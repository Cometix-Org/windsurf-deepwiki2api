VS Code extension written in TypeScript/ES2022 that exposes commands for generating Deepwiki-style context reports for selected symbols. Source lives under `src/` with subfolders for context builders (`src/context`), LSP helpers (`src/lsp`), rendering/output utilities, and command/activation wiring (`src/commands.ts`, `src/extension.ts`). Build tooling is esbuild plus TypeScript, ESLint 9, and npm scripts; the extension targets VS Code 1.103+.
