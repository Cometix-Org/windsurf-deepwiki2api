Codebase uses strict TypeScript (ES2022 target, Node16 modules) with VS Code extension APIs. Source follows modular service pattern (services instantiated in `extension.ts` and passed through `registerCommands`). Use modern async/await, prefer dependency injection via small service classes, and keep files ASCII-only. Linting uses ESLint 9 with TypeScript-eslint; adhere to VS Code API naming and event patterns.
